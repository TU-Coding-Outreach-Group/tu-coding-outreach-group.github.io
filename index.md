# Welcome to the Temple University Coding Outreach Group (COG)

This group is a resource for people in various fields, and at various training levels, who wish to strengthen their coding skills. Below are some of the resources and training we host.

## Office hours
COG "Office Hours" will be held on Tuesdays from 3-5pm during the Spring 2020 semester. Office hours are meant to serve as an open environment where people can come to work on personal coding and computational projects and get help from other attendees (as opposed to traditional office hours). If you are interested, please join the COG Google Group [link here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coding-outreach-group/join)

## [Summer Workshops](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020/blob/master/README.md)
Workshops focus on a specific research skill or topic and aim to have participants actively involved. These workshops try to be as hands-on as possible with the goal of teaching new skills and techniques to people who already have some coding experience.
