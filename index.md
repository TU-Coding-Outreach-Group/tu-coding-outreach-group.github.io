The Coding Outreach Group (COG) is a student-led organization aiming to make computer programming goals approachable and achievable for the Temple community. We host semi-annual coding bootcamps for beginners, hands-on skill workshops for intermediate to advanced coders, and regular office hours for people of all skill levels to find solutions to their coding problems. Our educational materials cover a wide range of topics, are free, open-source, and hosted here on our webpage as tutorials so learners can progress at their own pace. Our materials are self-generated by community members, too, so there's always a person you can reach out to when questions inevitably arise.   
  
COG has primarily been a volunteer effort from graduate students in the Psychology department, but we want to expand to other departments both in the service and materials we generate but also in the members who are actively serving and generating those materials. While we are well-versed in R, Python, Matlab, Bash, Javascript, and SPSS as they've been used in Psychology & Neuroscience, we'd love new perspectives and tools to expand our knowledgebase and better serve our community. 

## Office hours
COG "Office Hours" will be held every **Wednesday from 1-3pm** during the Fall 2022 semester. You can either attend in-person (Weiss 645) or via [zoom](https://temple.zoom.us/j/97809988629).

## Summer Workshops
Workshops focus on a specific research skill or topic and aim to have participants actively involved. These workshops try to be as hands-on as possible with the goal of teaching new skills and techniques to people who already have some coding experience.
